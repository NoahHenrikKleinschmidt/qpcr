# New Features in Next Version

This is a more cleaned up version of the previous TODO.md

### New `qpcr.Calibrator` class
The new `qpcr.Calibrator` allows calculation of qPCR primer efficiencies based 
a dilution series. It is able to work either with an entire assay as input or with
just a subset of specially labeled replicates and can compute, store, save, and load and later assign pre-computed efficiencies from and to `qpcr.Assay` objects. 

### New `EfficiencyCurves` Plotter 
Accompanying the `Calibrator` is a new plotter that can visualise the linear regression performed during efficiency computation, similar to how the `FilterSummary` plotter can summarise the workings of the `qpcr.Filters`. 

### Assays and Efficiency
Efficiency is now directly handled by the `qpcr.Assay` objects (`qpcr.Analyser` can still receive `.efficiency` as before, but this will be dropped at some point...)
