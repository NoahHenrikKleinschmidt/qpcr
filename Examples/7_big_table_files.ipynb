    "Levels of Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) sensitive (nmd) and insensitive (prot) transcript isoforms of HNRNPL and SRSF11 were measured by qPCR. As normalisers both 28S rRNA and Actin transcript levels were measured. The replicates are biological triplicates and technical douplicates. All measurements from the same qPCR sample were merged into hexaplicates (6 replicates). This was done in two separate HeLa cell lines (one with a specific gene knockout (KO), and one without (WT)), which were both treated to a plasmid-mediated rescue (+) or not (-), leading to four experimental conditions:\n",

    "----------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading a \"horizontal\" big table file is actually much more tricky than it's vertical counterpart. Why's that? Well, because in \"horizontal\" big table files the replicates are aligned in columns next to each other, and they usually have different column headers as well. That means we can no longer rely on a single column or even a specific `regex` pattern to extract our values. Instead we need to rely on `qpcr decorators` to help guide the parsing algorithm. To this end, we have the `@qpcr:group` decorator, which has to be placed _in the cell immediately above the first replicate column of each group_. Sounds too abstract? Check out the the `Getting Started` notebook again and look at the example there (it's actually not complicated at all).  "

(2018)](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.3274k) who analysed the expression of micro-RNAs (miRNAs) in alvular interstitial cells of dogs suffering from Canine myxomatous mitral valve disease. The architecture of the datafile they uploaded to Zenodo is a \"horizontal\" big table containing assays of miRNAs on separate rows and replicate Ct values from \"normal\" (healthy), \"mildly\" ill, or \"severely\" ill dogs as three replicate groups of five replicates each. \n",

Also, duplicate assays were dropped for the purpose of reading. Currently, the `BigTableReader` in `\"horizontal\"` parsing mode only supports *uniquely* labelled assays (so if there _are_ duplicate assays they must be differently labelled!)."
