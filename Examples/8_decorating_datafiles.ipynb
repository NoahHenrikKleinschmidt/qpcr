    "> Hence, `qpcr` can also not rely on identically named columns to find the data. To solve this problem without forcing the user to overly meddle with their data arrangement, `qpcr` opted to just rely on some additional decorators. The replicate values must be specified manually in this setting, of course. Therefore, a little more manual user effort is required to read such a datafile, but the decorator approach allows for an arbitrary amount of additional data to be stored alongside the raw Ct values, and is thus also appropriate for re-visiting and -analysing already exisiting data easily.\n",
