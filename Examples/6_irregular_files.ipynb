    "The corresponding experimental setup was as follows: \n",
    "Levels of Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) sensitive (nmd) and insensitive (prot) transcript isoforms of HNRNPL and SRSF11 were measured by qPCR. As normalisers both 28S rRNA and Actin transcript levels were measured. The replicates are biological triplicates and technical douplicates. All measurements from the same qPCR sample were merged into hexaplicates (6 replicates). This was done in two separate HeLa cell lines (one with a specific gene knockout (KO), and one without (WT)), which were both treated to a plasmid-mediated rescue (+) or not (-), leading to four experimental conditions:\n",

The `qpcr.Parsers` have a way of using `regex` to find such assay headers and read the assay identifiers from them. We can either specify a `regex` pattern directly or use a pre-defined one using their `assay_pattern` method, which is available as an argument via the `DataReader`. For this case the pattern is already implemented and can be accessed through the key `\"Rotor-Gene\"`. \n",
